1. **Why this action**: The action PAUSE_ADS_OR_INCREASE_PRICE is necessary because the current profit per unit is negative (₹-293.02), indicating that the product is being sold at a loss. With only 60 units left in stock and a critical risk level, it's essential to take immediate action to mitigate further losses.

2. **How to implement**: Pause all advertisements to stop incurring additional costs and consider increasing the price of the product to reduce losses. Alternatively, negotiate with suppliers to reduce costs or explore other cost-saving measures.

3. **Expected outcome**: By pausing ads, the company can prevent further losses. Increasing the price may lead to reduced sales, but it can help minimize losses per unit. The expected outcome is to reduce the financial impact of selling the remaining 60 units.

4. **Priority**: **HIGH**. The critical risk level and negative profit per unit require immediate attention to prevent further financial losses.",0.85,0.9
